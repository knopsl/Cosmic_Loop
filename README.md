Arduino based 12-bit Sampler with Bit Crushing &amp; Variable Sample Rate, Variable Playback Speed, and Lowpass filter.

Based on the Audio Hacker Shield and accompanying Header Files from Nootropic Design. Inspiration also from DigDugDIY who I believe also used the Nootropic Design audio shield and code as the basis of his "Lofi Dreams" sampler.

Eventually hope to add additional features like Reverse Playback, Granular Delay, and High Pass Filtering.

Current build requires an interface with 5 Buttons (connected as Digital Inputs) and 2 knobs (connected as analog inputs).
