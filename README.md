# Cosmic_Looper
Arduino based 12-bit Sampler with Bit Crushing &amp; Variable Sample Rate

Based on the Audio Hacker Shield and accompanying Header Files from Nootropic Design.

Eventually hope to add additional features like Reverse Playback, Granular Delay, and High Pass and Low Pass Filtering.

Current build requires an interface with 5 Buttons (connected as Digital Inputs) and 2 knobs (connected as analog inputs).
